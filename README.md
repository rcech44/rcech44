# Hey there!
I'm glad you found my GitHub page. I post some of my work here, nothing special. I'm still trying to get better and better in my favorite programming languages such as C++.

Coding and IT work isn't my only hobby, I also enjoy gaming, mobile astrophotography and even sports like running.
